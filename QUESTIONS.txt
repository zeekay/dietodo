(1) In /views/index.jade, what file is the bottom line loading?

  block scripts
    script(src='app.js')



(2) How is the functionality inside /client/js related to that in /views?



(3) In /app.coffee, when I call @render "template_file_name", which directories
    are being looked into? views/ ?




(4) what is this doing in app.coffee (inside app.extend ->)? Where is @set coming from?

  @set 'view options',
    layout: false
